        <H1>Traveling in Depression</H1>
        <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. it started after my 
         grandparents first  brought me to their home in frence and i have now 
         been to  twenty-nine different countries.Each has given me a u unique 
         learning experience.
         <br /><br />
         At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Town in the city 
         of lights. When I saw eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco
         feeding hordes of pigeons, the glided down venetian waterway on sleek
         gondoles. At thirteen, I saw the ancient megalithic structure of 
         stonehenge and walked along the great wall of china, amazed that the 
         thousand-year-old stone were still in place.
         <br /><br /> 
         It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first brcame
         interested in language.

         It began with frence, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I
         remember once asking a store owner in paris where Rus des Pyramides was.
         But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more
         accent on the A, she looked at me  bewildered.
         <br /><br /> 
         In the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and awareof its 
         similarities with English through congnates. baseball in spanish, for
         exmple, is beisbol which looks different but sound nearly the same 
         this was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehesion more 
         fluid, and even today i find that congnates come to the rescue when I 
         forget how to say something in spanish.
         <br /><br />
         Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for chinese. As I
         student chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was 
         missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words
         were formed by combining simple characters, so huo( ) meaning fire
         and shan ( ) meaning mountain can be joined to create huoshan (  ),
         which mean volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the 
         characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I from them
